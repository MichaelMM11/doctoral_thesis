%\section{Why Model Order Reduction?}
%{\color{Mblue}{[[ \cite[8]{schilders2008introduction}; \cite[11]{chen1999model}; \cite[2]{benner2021model} ]]}}

%Real world problems are too complex to be solved analytically. In classes one deals with simplifications like the projectile motions neglecting air resistance or \alert{!! second example needed} and representing electrons as point charges with no volume in space. However, if one applies the underlying equations to reality things are not so easy anymore. Partial differential equations (PDE) are usually the way to describe the laws of Physics. It turns out that by trying to solve these equations there is only in the rarest cases an algebraic expression as a solution. In all other cases equations must be solved numerically and are therefore only approximations to the problem. One approach to compute such approximations is using the finite element method (FEM). This computational technique discretizes the domain of interest into finite cells (mesh) and with given boundary conditions (BC) the field variable of the governing PDE is determined. The more accurate the solution should be the more cells and more grid points that define a cell are needed. Even for simple geometries the degrees of freedom (DOFs), \ie{} the numbers of unknown can be in orders of millions and billions. Using brute force (simply adding abundant computational power with RAM and fastest processors) is not advisable in terms of time and energy. Instead of dealing with the original large scale system model simplifications reduces complexity. The trick here is to get rid of all superfluous and unnecessary details that provide little to no contribution to the solution. This is where model order reduction (MOR) got its name. The following picture gives a rough explanation of this.

\section{Setup and results}
	\subsection{I-shape}
	Before diving into a real and complex setup I decided it is best to start with basic examples where calculations can be done by hand and prototyping yields to faster results. For this the most simplest setup was taken, a simple \dimens{2} rectangular setup with fixed temperature $\ind{T}[0]=\SI{20}{\kelvin}$ on the left and $\ind{T}[1]=\SI{200}{\kelvin}$ on the right. The ambient temperature $\ind{T}[\trm{amb}]$ was given by $\ind{T}[\trm{amb}]=\SI{293.15}{\kelvin}$. The geometry is modelled as copper and only the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ was used as material property. This property and value, however, does not play a major role in the benchmark setup. Same goes with mesh quality. For quick prototyping reasons coarse meshes were accepted.

	\end{longtable}
	In this setup the energy stored is $\ind{E}[\trm{stored}]=\num{2.685e6}$ and the first mode is contributing more than \SI{98}{\percent} of this value. That means that the first mode dominates the system. Having a look on the following left graph demonstrates this fact.

	\subsection{L-shape}
	To apply the code on a simple more complex geometry a \tit{L} was chosen with three different borders held constant. To generate a more diverse temperature distribution the fixed temperature values are $\ind{T}[0]=\SI{20}{\kelvin}$, $\ind{T}[1]=\SI{123}{\kelvin}$ and $\ind{T}[2]=\SI{200}{\kelvin}$. As in the previous case, ambient temperature was set to $\ind{T}[\trm{amb}]=\SI{293.15}{\kelvin}$.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{figure}[H]

				\end{subfigure}
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}
		\caption{}
		\label{}
	\end{figure}
	As in the case with the \tit{I}-shape the decay was of similar nature, \ie only few eigenvalues are needed to take the total energy stored in the system. The code didn't need any modification at all, only different snapshot file from \Comsol{} was loaded. As in the previous case 
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
				\begin{subfigure}[t]{\linewidth}
					\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=6cm]{images/L_shape_1t_POD.pdf}

					\caption{Temperature distribution after 5 time steps.}
				\end{subfigure}
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}
		\caption{The temperature distribution is slowly spreading through the geometry but it cannot be correct. As visible in the geometry the point $P(4,3)$ is obviously not part of the geometry but there is associated temperature to this point. That means that there is an error in postprocessing the data and remapping of the data values to the geometry must be done with a different approach. Mesh artefacts are tolerated at this time.}
		\label{}
	\end{figure}
	Next approach is not only export the data (nodes of mesh+values) but also the geometry from \Comsol. The nodes are not sufficient as artifacts will be created (here interpolation between nodes are performed and there is no naive way to \grqq{}force\grqq{} interpolation only on provided nodes). The interpolator has no way to understand if a connection line of nodes lies inside or outside the geometry and is therefore doomed to fail. So another approach has to be taken.
	My next trials is to outsource the geometry and the mesh-generation (probably with \Gmsh, generate snapshot matrix (probably with \Freefem), generate POD marix (already done) and then to the interpolation of this matrix on the original geometry+mesh (not sure how to do). First trials were successful, \ie geometry could be meshed and stationary \Poisson-PDE could be solved (switching to time-dependent situation is next step but no fundamental problem) with \Freefem. However, snapshot matrix needs to be extracted but should be possible.
