\section{Why Model Order Reduction?}
{\color{Mblue}{[[ \cite[8]{schilders2008introduction}; \cite[11]{chen1999model}; \cite[2]{benner2021model} ]]}}

Real world problems are too complex to be solved analytically. In classes one deals with simplifications like the projectile motions neglecting air resistance or \alert{!! second example needed} and representing electrons as point charges with no volume in space. However, if one applies the underlying equations to reality things are not so easy anymore. Partial differential equations (PDE) are usually the way to describe the laws of Physics. It turns out that by trying to solve these equations there is only in the rarest cases an algebraic expression as a solution. In all other cases equations must be solved numerically and are therefore only approximations to the problem. One approach to compute such approximations is using the finite element method (FEM). This computational technique discretizes the domain of interest into finite cells (mesh) and with given boundary conditions (BC) the field variable of the governing PDE is determined. The more accurate the solution should be the more cells and more grid points that define a cell are needed. Even for simple geometries the degrees of freedom (DOFs), \ie{} the numbers of unknown can be in orders of millions and billions. Using brute force (simply adding abundant computational power with RAM and fastest processors) is not advisable in terms of time and energy. Instead of dealing with the original large scale system model simplifications reduces complexity. The trick here is to get rid of all superfluous and unnecessary details that provide little to no contribution to the solution. This is where model order reduction (MOR) got its name. The following picture gives a rough explanation of this.

$X$: matrix from \Comsol{}; each row of the matrix consists of a sample solution taken at a specific value of time, and the number of rows in the matrix is the number of samples taken at evenly spaced values in time.

$\Sigma$ diagonal matrix, with $\ind{\sigma}[1]\geq\ind{\sigma}[2]\geq\dots\geq\ind{\sigma}[\min(m,n)]\geq0$ \\
$\ind{\sigma}[i]=\s{\ind{\lambda}[i](X\conjtrans{X})}$
$\conjtrans{X}$ is conjugate transpose (in $\C$) or simple transposed (in $\R$). \\
